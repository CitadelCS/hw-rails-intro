Modifying RottenPotatoes
========================

# Rails Intro: add features to RottenPotatoes

In this homework you will add a feature to an existing simple Rails app
and deploy the result publicly on the Heroku cloud hosting service.

General advice:  This homework involves modifying RottenPotatoes in
various ways. Git is your friend: commit frequently in case you
inadvertently break something that was working before! That way you can
always back up to an earlier revision, or just visually compare what
changed in each file since your last “good” commit. 

**Remember, commit early and often!**

# How to submit when you're all done

Deploying your finished app to Heroku by the homework deadline is part
of the grading process. Even if you have code checked in that works
properly, you still need to also deploy it to Heroku to get full
credit. 

For CSCI 420/602 fall 2019, create a submission document in DOCX or PDF format. In this document,
list your name and your partner's name, and the heroku link with your final, working code, all on
the first page. On the subsequent pages, paste in your code for `movies_controller.rb`, `movie.rb`,
and `index.html.haml`. Format in Consolas 10pt and start each new file on a new page.

Each student should upload a copy of the document to CitLearn by the deadline.
